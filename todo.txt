todo


## OFFLINE:
method 1:
- give a manual priority to each spot if map is known and not variant (assumed true for first torunament, not for following)

method 2:
- locate strategic points:
    - ones with few edges (seeing map as graph)?
    - ones being in a bonus with all edges in that bonus but one?
    - all edges at border?
    - ...
we may give more priority based on how may strategic point rules they respect.

## ONLINE:

- identify best target bonus considering:
    - the more territories owned the better
    - the less territories known owned by other the better
    - the percentage of owned territories of a bonus
    - the number of missing territories to complete bonus
    - the owned strategic points
    - the visible strategic points (and wether occupied by other)
    - ...

- strategy 
  - (better being attacked then attack)?
  - expansion (cannonball or spreader? depend on graph connecti)
  
## LOW LEVEL

- algorithms and data structure? 
- learning for offline part?
